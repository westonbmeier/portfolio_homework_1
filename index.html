            <p>    Hello future employer, My name in Weston Meier and I am lucky enough to live in beautiful Salt Lake City, Utah. I spent five years in Los Angeles, California as a musician. I found my love of coding between touring and rehearsal. 
                    I am extremely excited to be learning everything I can about programming and working on projects that are interesting and exciting.    
                    I have been a computer geek since I learned how to implement add-ons in World of Warcraft back in the Burning Crusade days.
                    <br><br> 
                    when I am not working on coding projects, you can find me in the kitchen. If I'm not in the kitchen, I am usually grocery shopping for ingredients to use in said kitchen. I find it very therapeutic to walk around a grocery store listening to a podcast
                    and picking out amazing things to put together. I love living downtown and taking my dog for walks around the city. My fiance and I enjoy going on vacation, taking our dog to Tanner Park and studying together.  </p>
